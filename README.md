# up4thetask

## The Problem
As post-secondary education becomes more and more of a commonplace, high school students often face anxiety as they transition from high school  to University/College. Also, the transition and difficulty between high school and post-secondary can be overwhelming especially when juggling life, friends, good health, and work.

## Our Answer
Thus, we, up4thechallenge, have gamified the school work/life balance in post-secondary school in hopes to raise awareness and to help high school students to understand more of what university/college will be like. Whether the students choose to better prepare themselves or relax during summer vacation now knowing what lies ahead of them is up to the students, and we hope that through raising awareness, we can reduce some of their anxiety.

## What is it?
up4thetask is a multitasking game that lets the user play up to four different minigames at once. Also, these games are closely related to the university life. Common themes are based around food/nutrition, marks, romantic relationships, and getitng proper sleep.
